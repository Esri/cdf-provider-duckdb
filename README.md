# BDT_cdf
This repo is an exploratory effort into using custom data feeds with big data. 

## ü¶Ü See it in action with DuckDB on he NY City Taxi parquet Dataset (1 million rows): 
https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2747d827-4365-4785-985a-7614ad55ed06

## ‚ö° Quickstart
- If you are wanting to use the existing providers and data feeds inside of this repo under `/bdt_cdf`, just do `npm install` (note: this is untested)
- Then to run do `npm start` which will start up the express server. To confirm things are working send a GET request to `localhost:8080/csv/rest/info`. The following routes should be displayed when running the start command 
```console
2024-06-27T17:46:32.174Z info: registered cache: Cache v6.0.0
2024-06-27T17:46:32.177Z info: registered output: GeoServices v8.1.12
2024-06-27T17:46:32.185Z info: "GeoServices" routes for the "csv" provider:

## ‚ùì How do I make my own custom data feed?: 
See the most up to date [documentation](https://developers.arcgis.com/enterprise-sdk/guide/custom-data-feeds/pass-through-custom-data-providers/)

### Step 1 - NodeJS and CDF CLI Installation:
- Install NodeJS using nvm or just manually installing the msi installer. I manually downloaded 20.11.1 windows msi from these [versions](https://nodejs.org/dist/). See this [document](https://developers.arcgis.com/enterprise-sdk/guide/custom-data-feeds/installing-and-configuring-custom-data-feeds/) for matching ArcGIS Enterprise versions. 
- Install ArcGIS Enterprise SDK by manually installing the exe from Esri internal release network drive (must be on Esri network) `\\esri.com\software\Esri\Released\113_Final` with the file name `ArcGIS_Enterprise_SDK_Windows_113_190284.exe`. Copy this to your desktop and run the exe
- After following through setup, restart your cmd window and then do `cdf -h`. This is supposed to display a help menu after installing. For me nothing showed up, so I went to `C:\Program Files\ArcGIS\EnterpriseSDK\customdatacli` and ran `activate_cdf.bat` which solved my issues and made `cdf` a recognizable command.

### Step 2 - Creating a new custom datafeed application:
- Once the CDF cli is installed from the Enterprise SDK, do `cdf createapp new_cdf` which will generate a bunch of nodeJS boilerplate for you (`/bdt_cdf` contains an example of all of this boilerplate). A custom datafeed is built on top of [Koop](https://koopjs.github.io/docs) which is built with [express.js](https://expressjs.com/)

### Step 3 - Create your own custom data provider for your data source:
- To create a new custom data feed you need to make a data provider. `cd` into your new app directory and then do `cdf createprovider <customprovidername>`
- This will add a `/providers` folder and within this there will be a folder named what you named it above 
- Within the provider there is a `model.js` file which handles the logic for fetching the data and returning GeoJSON 
- For a simple example on how this works see `providers/csv` which is forked from [koop-provider-csv](https://github.com/koopjs/koop-provider-csv). The `model.js` reads from a `config/default.json` which contains metadata and information about the schema structure of the csv. It then uses [Papaparse](https://www.papaparse.com/) to read the csv and then translate it to GeoJSON (see `utils/translate-csv.js`)
- After adding code to fetch your data from your datasource and return as GeoJSON, test the server with `npm start` which should display a list of routes in the terminal
- One key thing to note is that there is important metadata and filters that are set on the GeoJSON object you return from your `model.js` file. See [here](https://github.com/koopjs/FeatureServer#featureserverroute) for a list of all the flags to be set and see `providers/duckdb` for an example
- To see a query parameter list that will be sent to your CDF geoservice API see [here](https://developers.arcgis.com/rest/services-reference/enterprise/query-feature-service-layer/)
- Koop contains existing provider [plugins](https://koopjs.github.io/docs/available-plugins/providers) you can use as an example
- To see complex examples with pagination and SQL queries see `/providers/duckb` and [elastic-sql](https://github.com/koopjs/koop-provider-elastic-sql/tree/main)

### Step 4 - Testing your CDF locally: 
- To do local development on your CDF and test it you need to send GET requests to your feature server url
- One way to do this is using something like [postman](https://www.postman.com/) or with the vs code extension [postcode](https://github.com/rohinivsenthil/postcode)
- Postman/Postcode is nice for quick testing but there is no map component. To get a map UI, you can also use the ArcGIS JS API to create a featureLayer object in a html file. See `frontend/index.html` for an example of this 

### Step 5 - Deploying a CDF to production:
- One option is to use docker and package your server to run in the cloud as a docker container
- Another option is to use the cdf cli that comes with the ArcGIS Enterprise SDK. Do `cdf export <providername>` which will export the code into a `.cdpk` file. 
- Take the `.cdpk` file and upload it to ArcGIS Server using the ArcGIS Server REST Admin API upload operation see more [here](https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/products/arcgis-enterprise/developers/new-in-arcgis-enterprise-11-1-custom-data-feeds/)
- A `.cdpk` is just a renamed zip file of your data provider code that is uploaded to ArcGIS Server for deployment

### Step 6 - ArcGIS Server Installation: 
- If you don't have an Enterprise server setup, you'll need a virtual machine. Here is a helpful step by step [guide](https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/server/latest/install/windows/steps-to-get-arcgis-for-server-up-and-running.htm)
- First install `ArcGIS_Server_Windows_113_190188.exe` from Esri internal release network drive (must be on Esri network) `\\esri.com\software\Esri\Released\113_Final`
- TODO

## Understanding how geoservices rest API clients work at a high level: 
I failed to understand how the interaction works between client and server with geoservices for a while and was quite confused. Hopefully this short write up will help you! The query documentation is listed [here](https://developers.arcgis.com/rest/services-reference/enterprise/query-feature-service-layer/) and see more details [here](https://developers.arcgis.com/enterprise-sdk/guide/custom-data-feeds/pass-through-custom-data-providers/)
- At high level first an ArcGIS/Geoservices client makes a request to your feature server example `http://127.0.0.1:8080/duckdb/rest/services/myparquet/FeatureServer/0?f=json`. This initial request is just asking for metadata and information about the data server
- Then the client makes another initial request to something like `http://127.0.0.1:8080/duckdb/rest/services/myparquet/FeatureServer/0/query?f=json&returnIdsOnly=true&returnCountOnly=true&orderByFields=&outSR=102100&returnGeometry=false&spatialRel=esriSpatialRelIntersects&where=1%3D1` because of the `returnIdsOnly` and `returnCountOnly` fields, this request is just asking for the size of your data source.
- Once the client knows metadata about your feature server and the size of your data source, its able to make queries with pagination as the user scrolls and pans the map
